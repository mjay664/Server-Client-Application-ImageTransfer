# Server-Client-Application-ImageTransfer
A simple server client based application. Server is developed in Java and client is developed for android device. Two clients can connect to server using host address and port number provided by server. Server and clients must be connected to same network.
Clients can send each other text messages and images. Images are sent by converting each pixel to Unicode characters. Idea behind it was that some middle man could not see image, he/she only see some random characters and not some image.
Android application was developed for Android 5 so it may not work in later versions of android.
